        <p>Plan it! Was created by 8 university students who came together and realised they had one thing in common, wanting to be money savvy. <br><br>
            
        When planning events and activities to do you want to be sure that you arenâ€™t wasting your time or money. Which is exactly how we felt. The 8 of us wanted to develop a site where people are able to do a quick scroll through audience targeted sections to find pubs, clubs and events that will be worth your money.</p>
